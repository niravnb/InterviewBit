/*
Rearrange a given array so that Arr[i] becomes Arr[Arr[i]] with O(1) extra space.

Example:

Input : [1, 0]
Return : [0, 1]
 Lets say N = size of the array. Then, following holds true :
All elements in the array are in the range [0, N-1]
N * N does not overflow for a signed integer

void Solution::arrange(vector<int> &A) {
    // Do not write main() function.
    // Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function.
    // Do not print the output, instead return values as specified
    // Still have a doubt. Checkout www.interviewbit.com/pages/sample_codes/ for more details

    int n = A.size();
    
    for(int i = 0; i< n; i++){
        A[i] +=  A[A[i]]%n*n;
    }
    
    for(int i = 0; i< n; i++){
        A[i] = (int)A[i]/n;
    }
    
}

If you had extra space to do it, the problem will be very easy.
Store a copy of Arr in B.

And then for every element, do Arr[i] = B[B[i]]

Lets restate what we just said for extra space :

If we could somehow store 2 numbers in every index ( that is, Arr[i] can contain the old value and the new value somehow ), then the problem becomes very easy.
NewValue of Arr[i] = OldValue of Arr[OldValue of Arr[i]]

Now, we will do a slight trick to encode 2 numbers in one index.
This trick assumes that N * N does not overflow.

1) Increase every Array element Arr[i] by (Arr[Arr[i]] % n)*n.
2) Divide every element by N.
Given a number as

   A = B + C * N   if ( B, C < N )
   A % N = B
   A / N = C
We use this fact to encode 2 numbers into each element of Arr.
